I'm a second year computer science grad student at the University of Groningen and a core developer of [Flask Monitoring Dashboard](https://github.com/flask-dashboard/Flask-MonitoringDashboard). I'm currently (April 2019) working on my master's thesis, called *Measuring the Performance of a Performance Monitor. The case of the Flask Monitoring Dashboard.*
